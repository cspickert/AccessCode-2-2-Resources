# Resources Readme
# 
An attempt to make all the resources mentioned in iOS class and Slack
sticky. Resources used in class or during the interview process have no
attribution (since we are all already familiar with them), while
resources mentioned by classmates, professors and TA's in conversations
outside the context of class are followed by the name of the person who
mentioned the resource (if it is known).
